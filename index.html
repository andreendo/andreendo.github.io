	<b>Bio:</b> Received a bachelor's degree in Analysis of Systems from the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (DCT-UFMS), Brazil in 2005. I also hold M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICMC-USP), Brazil, awarded in 2008 and 2013, respectively. I worked as a postdoc at Aarhus University, Denmark, under Prof. Anders Møller. From 2013 to now, I am an Assistant Professor at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR), Cornelio Procopio, Brazil. Since I left my hometown Alvares Machado in 2002, I have pursued my professional passions for computers, programming, and research.
